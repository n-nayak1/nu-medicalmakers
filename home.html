    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      We aim to design innovative solutions to <b>real-world</b> healthcare challenges by collaborating across disciplines and partnering with patients and clinicians. From idea to impact, we build devices that <b>make a difference</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We empower students with hands-on experience in medical device design. By prioritizing upskilling through the prototyping process, we offer members the opportunity to build technical skills while transforming their ideas into <b>impactful</b> solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typically, we have 3 different project teams with 10-15 members each. We leverage our partnerships with the <b>Shirley Ryan AbilityLab</b> and <b>Stryker Corporation</b> to inform our project decisions and prepare our students for an industry role in the medical devices industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Open to all enrolled Northwestern students, regardless of major or experience level.</i>
